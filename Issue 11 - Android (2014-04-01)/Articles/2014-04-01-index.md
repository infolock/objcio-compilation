objc.io goes Android. Although this started out as an idea for an April Fools' joke, it matured into a really good issue about Android development for Objective-C developers. After all, it's interesting and instructive to learn about what developing for the other major mobile platform is like. 

We've been very busy the last month finishing one of our own projects â€“ [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com). Therefore, we were delighted that many great Android developers chipped in with their knowledge of the Android platform, covering topics ranging from application structure over notifications and databases to dependency injection in Java.
